# Boom-It-Game-Unity

Game Idea and Concept ​ -  
The idea is a bit weird and funny. User has to disintegrate a site using minimum resources. There will be various bombs types like dynamites, sky-drop bombs, TNT, grenades, etc. made available to the user to disintegrate a site into pieces. To pass a certain level every stick man at the site needs to be killed. Game play will based on natural physics laws (like gravity), and also user will have to minimize bomb usage and create maximum destruction. There will be levels with increasing difficulty in the game play.  

Basic Game Play and Design ​ -  
Place bombs on various locations on the demolition site and click Boom when you're ready to detonate. Use as few bombs as possible to boost your score and maximize the destruction. For example, below is demolition site, user will have bombs to be placed anywhere in the red brick region of the box. But to cross the level he need to place it at the bottom of the building, so structure falls and disintegrates the stick man standing. Score = 100 when 1 bomb is used and Score = 200 when 2 bombs are used.
